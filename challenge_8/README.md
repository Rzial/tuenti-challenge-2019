#### Challenge 8 - Tasty secrets
Twenty years ago, legendary chef Aquiles Yenaba embarked on a journey to find the ultimate recipe. After succeeding with his dream he safely stored the recipe on his own website, which he built using some uncommon security measures. Afterwards he shared some of the site's recipes with his closest friends, but none of them could get their hands on the ultimate secret.

We, a secret gourmet hackers organization, tried to force our way into the site. But after countless efforts we could only get to the login page, and all our bruteforce efforts were unsuccessful. We've also heard that some other gourmet hacker organization have also been targeting the site. But they were one step ahead of us and they've gotten the source code!

That is why we decided to contact you. We need you to get access to the ultimate recipe before that organization uses it for its own evil purposes. Please help us with our plans, Mr. SuperNoodleHacker!

Note: the outputs for the test and submit phases are the same.
Note 2: This level should be solved without any brute-forcing. Doing too many requests on our server may result in a temporary ban or even a disqualification.
