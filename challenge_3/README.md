# Challenge 3 - Origami Punchout
We've just received a brand new hole puncher and we'd like you to help us to try it out!

A nice way to get beautiful symmetrical patterns is to fold a piece of paper a few times and then punch some holes in it.

But before we starting to punch holes blindly, you're tasked with writing a program to predict what the resulting patterns will be given a specification of how the folds are made and the locations of the holes on the punched piece of paper.

#### Input
The first line **N** is an integer specifying the number of cases. N cases will follow. Each case is made up of the following:

> W H F P \
> Folds \
> Punches

Where **W** is the Width of the folded paper, **H** is the height of the folded paper, **F** is the number of folds and **P** is the number of holes in the folded paper.

**Folds** are **F** lines, each containing a single character from the literal set [_LRTB_]. Where _L_, _R_, _T_ and _B_ stand for Left, Right, Top and Bottom respectively. This indicates what side the paper was been folded on in reverse order starting from the folded piece of paper and going backwards to the completely unfolded piece of paper).

**Punches** are **P** lines. Each line has the horizontal and vertical (respectively) coordinates for a punch on the folded paper as **x y** tuple of integers separated by a single white space.

The punch coordinates can be seen as positions on a discrete grid where the top left corner of the bounding square of the punch hole has a width and height of one unit.

The origin of coordinates _(0, 0)_ is always the top left corner and it changes each time the paper is unfolded on the top or left sides. Keep this in mind when computing the coordinates of the holes as the paper is unfolded.

You can assume the input will be well formed (no invalid numbers, no invalid fold directions, no coordinates outside of the paper area and the number of lines matches the specified amounts, etc.)

#### Output
**N** solutions, one for each case **n** that starts with a single line Case #**n**: followed by the coordinates of the holes punched in the unfolded paper (one per line) in the same format as the input (**x** and **y** coordinates separated by a space). The coordinates should be sorted by **x**, then **y**, in ascending order.

#### Limits
> 0 < W < 10000 \
> 0 < H < 10000 \
> 0 ≤ F < 16 \
> 0 ≤ P < 100

####Sample Input
Consider the following input:

> 1 \
> 4 2 2 2 \
> T \
> R \
> 0 0 \
> 2 1

This stands for:

* One test case
* 4 units wide, 2 units tall, 2 folds, 2 punches
* First fold on the top side
* Second fold on the right side
* First punch at x=0, y=0
* Second punch at x=2, y=1
The shape of the piece of folded paper is as follows (where \`o\` is a punched hole in the paper and \`x\` an unperforated area):

```
---- ← this is the top side, where the first folding was done
oxxx
xxox
```

as it has been folded on the top (_T_), when unfolded it will give the following piece of paper, which is still folded on the right (_R_)

```
xxox|
oxxx|
----| ← this was the top side, now it's the middle vertical
oxxx|
xxox|
    ↑
    this is the right side, where it’s currently folded
```
after unfolding again, this is the resulting final piece of paper:
```
    this was the right side, now it's in the middle horizontal
    ↓
xxox|xoxx
oxxx|xxxo
----+----
oxxx|xxxo
xxox|xoxx
```

#### Sample Output
There are eight holes in the resulting piece of paper when it’s fully unfolded:

> Case #1: \
> 0 1 \
> 0 2 \
> 2 0 \
> 2 3 \
> 5 0 \
> 5 3 \
> 7 1 \
> 7 2
